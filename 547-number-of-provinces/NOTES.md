Direct Application of Set Union, we need to group all the connected components into one and then count number of components
The Way we approach the Set Union Question,
1. Make the parent vector and rank vector and their general initilization.
2. Find Parent Function and Rank by union function.
3. Loop and get all the connected components
4. Now loop over the parent vector accumulate in different groups
5. and then return the size of the map;
